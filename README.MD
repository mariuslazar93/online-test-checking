# Online Test Checker
Small webapp that checks how many correct responses a student gave to an exam.

## Motivation
Testing out the Bulma CSS Framework and the process for deploying a new site with Netlify.

Combining learning with actualy solving a problem, this site was also made to help a teacher improve the time spent on checking the students answers to a test. Instead of correcting the answers on paper and counting them afterwards, she can now introduce the student's answers on the page and have the number of correct answers instantly.
