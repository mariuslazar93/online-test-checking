# Online Test Checker
Small webapp that checks how many correct responses a student gave to an exam. The exam must consist of only single answer questions.

## Motivation
Testing out the Bulma CSS Framework and the process for deploying a new site with Netlify.

Combining learning with actually solving a problem, this site was also made to help a teacher improve the time spent on checking the students answers to a test. Instead of correcting the answers on paper and counting them afterwards, she can now introduce the student's answers on the page and have the number of correct answers instantly.

## How to use
First, enter the correct answers for the test.
Second, enter the student's responses.
Three, see the magic.

Use dash (-) if no answer is provided for a question.
If student only answered 50 out of 100 questions, the remaining 50 will be considered wrong answer.
